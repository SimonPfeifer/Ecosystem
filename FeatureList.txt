Below is a 'work-in-progess' list of features, 
possible improvements, creative and/or practical
ideas, notes and anything else that felt important
enough at the time to write down.

It is organised as follows:
- Major categories are in capital letters surrounded 
  by '#'
- Subcategories therein are preceded by a '##'
- Headings within each category are denoted by a 
  single '-'
- Every item which expands on a previouse point has
  one additional '-' relative to it, e.g.:


################## CORE SYSTEM #####################
## Neural Network (NN)
- Training
-- Purely numerical (no graphical output)
-- Output snapshots after N epochs containing 
   weights matrices, NN architecture, etc. (all 
   output needed to construct and run an instance)

- Running
-- Write routine able to import a snapshot file


## Graphical Interface
- Interactive
-- Switches enable/disable info overlay

- Record instead of real-time playback 


################## AGENT ###########################
## Neural Network (NN)
- Reinforcement learning neural network (RLNN)
-- Q-function

- Input
-- Vision
--- Input pixel values of vision field

- Output
-- Vector of possible states (e.g. left)


## Abilities
- Health
-- Health==Hunger
-- Health decreases over time
--- Eating increases health
---- Eating is automatic within distance of food
---- Eating is a state (i.e. requires NN output)

- Movement
-- Orientation? Agent-space or window-space (Up, 
   down, left, right vs forward, back, left, right)
-- Variable quantities 
--- Speed
--- Acceleration
--- Turning circle

- Vision
-- Vision field
--- Simple geometric shape specifies vision field
-- Size and shape of vision field can vary

- Smell
-- Smell objects within radius
-- Signal decreases with increased range from object


################## ENVIRONMENT #####################
## Food
- Spawn distribution
-- Random 
-- Uniform
-- Nonuniform
--- High/low intensity areas
--- Perlin noise

- Spawn rate
-- High rate encourages camping
-- Low rate encourages migration

- Despawn?

- Physical properties
-- Shape
-- Colour
-- Smell


## Biomes 
- Generate environments with a set of properties
- Distribute across map
